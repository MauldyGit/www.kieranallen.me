        <p>
          As a Frontend Developer at OVO Energy I work as part of a team to
          acquire new customers and retain current customers through our
          Acquistion and Renwal flows. I work primarily with AngularJS and
          ReactJS, both of which leverage the TypeScript library in order to
          create safer code.

        </header>
        <p>
          As a UI Developer at Playtech I work extensively with data heavy
          customer facing React.JS applications. My team follow the scrum
          methodology with week long sprints and daily stand-up meetings to
          inform others on work done. As part of my team I carry out daily code
          reviews to ensure quality of code across all applications is
          maintained.
        </p>
        <p>Some projects I have worked on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Implemented localised date and number formatting for clients using
            the react-intl library. This feature greatly improved the user
            experience for clients located outside the United Kingdom.
          </li>
          <li>
            Developed a native fetch component to handle all of the applications
            api requests, thus removing any need for JQuery in our build.
          </li>
          <li>
            Successfully reworked our redux store to be used across all
            applications instead of using separate stores for each application.
            This greatly simplified our codebase and cut down on a lot of
            duplicate code.
          </li>
