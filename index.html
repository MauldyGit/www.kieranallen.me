					As a Frontend Developer at OVO Energy I
					work as part of a team to acquire new
					customers and retain current customers
					through our Acquistion and Renwal flows.
					I work primarily with AngularJS and
					ReactJS, both of which leverage the
					TypeScript library in order to create
					safer code.
				</p>
				<p>Some projects I have worked on:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Migration of the OVO acquistion
						frontend from AngularJS to
						ReactJS.
						<ul>
							<li>
								73% decrease in
								time to
								interactive.
							</li>
							<li>
								36% reduction in
								Javascript
								package size.
							</li>
							<li>
								98% reduction in
								css package
								size.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Migration of team applications
						to a new AWS account.

					<h4>September 2016 - April 2018</h4>

				<p>
					As a UI Developer at Playtech I work
					extensively with data heavy customer
					facing React.JS applications. My team
					follow the scrum methodology with week
					long sprints and daily stand-up meetings
					to inform others on work done. As part
					of my team I carry out daily code
					reviews to ensure quality of code across
					all applications is maintained.
				</p>
				<p>Some projects I have worked on:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Implemented localised date and
						number formatting for clients
						using the react-intl library.
						This feature greatly improved
						the user experience for clients
						located outside the United
						Kingdom.
					</li>
					<li>
						Developed a native fetch
						component to handle all of the
						applications api requests, thus
						removing any need for JQuery in
						our build.
					</li>
					<li>
						Successfully reworked our redux
						store to be used across all
						applications instead of using
						separate stores for each
						application. This greatly
						simplified our codebase and cut
						down on a lot of duplicate code.
					</li>
